## Research Plan for Book on 1970s Hot Rods

### Phase 1 Objectives:
1. **Comprehensive Research**:
   - Investigate 1970s hot rod models (e.g., Mopar E-body, HEMI 'Cuda, Challenger, Rebel 'Machine')
   - Study the impact of the 1973 oil crisis on hot rod design
   - Analyze customization trends (engine swaps, paint techniques, body modifications)
   - Map cultural influences (media portrayals, Hot Rod Magazine, Street Rod Nationals)

2. **Outline Development**:
   - Create a 10-chapter structure based on historical context, key models, and preservation efforts
   - Organize chapters into sections: 
      - Historical overview
      - Model-specific showcases
      - Cultural and technical transitions

3. **Source Verification**:
   - Cite primary sources like factory specifications, builder interviews, and original magazine articles

### Key Research Themes:
- The 1970 model year as a peak for performance before emissions regulations
- Fiberglass use in 1970s custom bodies (e.g., LeVan Prothero's 210-mph Camaro)
- The rise of the National Street Rod Association in the late 1970s
- Shift from racing-focused hot rods to nostalgia 'retro rods'
