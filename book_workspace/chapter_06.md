# Chapter 6: The Role of Media and Publications


## Hot Rod Magazine and 1970s Hot Rod Culture


### Media as a Catalyst for Change

*HOT ROD* magazine played a pivotal role in shaping hot rod culture through the 1970s. By blending racing coverage with grassroots modifications, it became the definitive guide for enthusiasts navigating an era of fuel crises, emissions regulations, and shifting consumer trends.

- **Government Regulation Coverage**: The magazine’s editorials on emissions restrictions and the oil crisis (e.g., "The Hot Roder’s Better Idea: A V8 in a Vega" (1973)) sparked debates about personal freedom versus environmental responsibility.

- **Van Craze**: *HOT ROD* initially promoted the “West Coast Vans” movement, offering builds like the “Denimachine” (1972 Ford van collaboration with Coke and Levi Strauss). Despite a temporary sales spike, the shift alienated traditional hot rodders. ([*Van ROD* Challenges](https://www.hotrod.com/features/the-1970s-982-1631-82-1))

### Merging Magazines and Expanding Scope

In 1971, *HOT ROD* merged with *Rod & Custom* to create *HOT ROD & ROD & CUSTOM*, doubling its page count. This merger:
- Standardized “street rod” coverage
- Promoted SCCA racing culture through features like:
  - *Bill Jenkins' Vega Pro Stocker* (1972)
  - *Mickey Thompson’s Land Speed Records* ([Editor Terry Cook’s Reflections](https://www.hotrod.com/features/hot-rod-75th-anniversary-former-editors-terry-cook))

### Grassroots Innovations Spotlight

*HOT ROD* chronicled the era’s innovation:
- **Street Rod Revolution**: 1973’s “Blue Chevelle Street Machine” cover story became the blueprint for modern street rod builds.
- **Muffler Testing Controversy**: A 1973 dyno-comparison test of exhaust systems angered manufacturers but became a readers’ favorite ([Muffler Test](https://www.hotrod.com/features/hot-rod-75th-anniversary-former-editors-terry-cook)).

### Broader Media Impact

- **Film & Music**: *HOT ROD* influenced car culture beyond print:
  - The 1971 film *Vanishing Point* (featuring a 1970 Dodge Challenger) was referenced in multiple issues.
  - Rock ‘n’ roll (e.g., “Highway Star” by Deep Purple) mirrored the era’s speed-centric ethos ([National Hot Rod Day Tributes](https://americancollectors.com/articles/national-hot-rod-day/)).
- **TV Ignorance**: During the 1970s, TV networks largely ignored racing, making *HOT ROD* the primary source for SCCA and NHRA updates ([Hot Rod TV Coverage](https://shoppress.dormanproducts.com/hot-rod-magazine-75-years-book-review/)).

### Legacy of Media Coverage

- **Street Rod Normalization**: By 1975, *HOT ROD* had cemented the street rod as a post-fuel crisis alternative to modified muscle cars.
- **Reader-Driven Content**: Features like the “Tech Line” column (1972) turned readers into amateur experts, democratizing hot rodding knowledge.

## Other Media Forms

- **1973 *American Graffiti***: Popularized 1960s cars but indirectly spurred 1970s “restomod” trends.
- **Custom Van Movement**: *HOT ROD*’s van coverage (1970–1974) created a fleeting fad that influenced later customization trends.
