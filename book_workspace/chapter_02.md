# Chapter 2: The Golden Year - 1970 and Peak Performance

## Mopar Dominance: HEMI 'Cuda and Challenger
1970 marked Mopar's crowning achievement with the introduction of the 426 HEMI-powered Plymouth 'Cuda and Dodge Challenger. These cars epitomized American muscle, with the 'Cuda's 426 HEMI engine producing 425 horsepowerâ€”later upgraded to 440 HEMI in some models. The Challenger, while slightly less powerful, offered a balanced combination of performance and practicality.

### Key Models and Their Legacy
- **1970 Plymouth Superbird**: A limited-production NASCAR-inspired machine with a 426 HEMI and distinctive nose cone. 
- **AMC Rebel 'Machine**': American Motors' answer to the muscle car war, featuring a 390-cubic-inch engine. 
- **Ford Torino Talladega**: Despite being underpowered due to restrictions, Ford's 1970 Talladega was a drag racing icon.

## Big-Block Engines vs. Emissions Regulations
While 1970 represented the pinnacle of factory performance, it also signaled a turning point. Stricter emissions controls and rising insurance costs began to suppress horsepower across all automakers. The HEMI engine was phased out after 1971, replaced by less powerful V8s in response to regulatory pressures.

## The 1970s Muscle Car Legacy
As cited in _OnAllCylinders_: "1970 was when power and performance reached their peak before emissions regulations and design limitations curtailed innovation." This chapter concludes by highlighting how the 1970 models became benchmarks for hot rodders, influencing builds well into the 21st century. Next, Chapter 3 will explore the oil crisis and its impact on design.
