| **Big-Block Engine** | Large displacement V8 (454-500+ cu.in.) that powered 1970s hot rods. Limited by emissions and CAFE regulations after 1973. |
| **Catalytic Converter** | Emissions device reducing exhaust pollutants, but decreasing horsepower. Required by law in 1975. |
| **Clean Air Act (1970)** | Federal regulation mandating 90% reductions in vehicle emissions by 1975, leading to catalytic converters and horsepower restrictions. |
