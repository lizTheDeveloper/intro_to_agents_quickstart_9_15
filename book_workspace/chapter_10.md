# Chapter 10: Preserving the 1970s Hot Rod Legacy

## Restoration Techniques for Vintage Hot Rods

1. **Authentic Component Sourcing**:
   - **NOS Parts**: High demand for National Stock Number (NSN) components like 1971–1973 Dana 44 rear ends
   - **Reproduction Kits**: Companies like Cal-Metal (TH400 transmissions) and Mopar (HEMI manifold replicas) fill gaps in original parts


2. **Rust Protection Standards**:
   - **Welded Frames**: Steel frames treated with undercoating (e.g., Rust-Oleum 768) for 1970–1975 Mopars
   - **Aluminum Substitutions**: 1973–1975 Fords often get aluminum floor pans to prevent corrosion


3. **Period-Correct Engineering**:
   - **Engine Rebuilds**: HEMI rebuilds follow 1970s specs (e.g., 0.010" overbore for 426 blocks)
   - **Electrical Systems**: Restorers use non-PCB capacitors to match 1970s-era components

## The National Street Rod Association (NSRA) Role


1. **Certification Standards**:
   - **Class A Certification**: Requires 90% original components with minimal modifications
   - **Class B Certification**: Allows 20% modern enhancements (e.g., disc brakes on 1970s Dodges)

2. **Preservation Guidelines**:
   - **Wiring Standards**: NSRA mandates original loom routing, not modern harnesses
   - **Interior Rules**: Upholstery must use 1970s-spec vinyl (e.g., Chrysler D186 code) for Class A builds


3. **Events**:
   - **Annual Show Awards**: Judges 1970s builds based on historical accuracy
   - **Workshops**: Teaches traditional techniques like 1970s-style body filler application
